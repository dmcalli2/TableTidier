Endoscopy as-sessments at week 8 (pooled ustekinumab vs placebo) (A), by induction study (B); randomized pa-tients with eligible SES-CD score or ulcerations at in-duction baseline. NOTE. (1) Pooled ustekinumab group comprises patients receiving ustekinumab 130 mg and tiered ustekinu-mab doses approximating 6 mg/kg combined. For analyses, patients who, prior to the designated analysis timepoint, had a CD-related surgery due to lack of efﬁcacy or had an initiation of speciﬁed prohibited medication had their baseline value carried forward or were considered to not have mucosal healing. Patients with missing segments at the designated analysis timepoint had their base-line score or ulceration status at baseline for the missing segment(s) carried forward. (2) Clinically-meaningful endoscopic improvement: SES-CD reduction 3 from induction baseline; Endoscopic response: SES-CD reduc-tion 50% from induction baseline; Endoscopic remission: SES-CD total score 2; Mucosal healing: Complete absence of ul-cers in patients with ulcers at baseline.
